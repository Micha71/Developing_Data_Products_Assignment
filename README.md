Slidify presentation for Data Science course Johns Hopkins University

This Slidify presentation in html format (file index.html) presents a pitch on how projects are evaluated by means of customer reviews. 
We used a default dataset as an example to show how the mean value for the questionnaire is calculated. 

The entire project evaluation sheet application is written in a Shiny App 
and can be consulted via https://micha71.shinyapps.io/Assignment/
